# TypeScript SDK

`momobase` is a typed client for the Momobase application and administration APIs. Use it when a TypeScript service or trusted web application should call Momobase without managing HTTP envelopes and access-token refresh directly.

## Choose a client

| Client                | Use it for                                                                       | Credential                                                  |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MomobaseClient`      | Listing payment methods, creating payments, and reading application transactions | Application client ID and secret                            |
| `MomobaseAdminClient` | Managing operators, applications, providers, routes, and system data             | Administrator email and password, or an existing token pair |

Both clients use the global `fetch()` implementation available in modern browsers and Node.js. They return the `data` value from Momobase response envelopes and throw `MomobaseAPIError` for unsuccessful HTTP responses.

::: warning Keep application secrets on a trusted server
`MomobaseClient` holds an application client secret. Do not include that secret in a public browser or mobile bundle. Call it from a backend-for-frontend or another trusted service.
